# Introduction

The variables used and the functions called by the tidy.r are described in this document, the objective of the run_analysis.R code is to perform analysis and achieve the objectives mentioned under objectives section in README.md

Libraries used: dplyr is used apart from the standard libraries loaded by default in R Studio

Datasets: Datasets are downloaded from the link http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

#Funcations used:
setwd: to set the path of the working directory
read.table: to read the datasets in a tabular format
names: to set the names of the dataset
which(): to find the columns(number) which makes the condition within the function braces
duplicated: to find the duplicates in the datasets
mutate: to perform transformation of the dataframe used to add a new column in our analysis
cbind: to add vectors as a column to the dataframe
rbind: to combine two dataframes as rows
grep: Finds the pattern in the dataframe based on the condition given in the braces
merge: to join two data frames based on a common vector
gsub: to substitute a string with some other string based on pattern
select:to select vectors or part of a data frame
group_by: to group the data frame based on the vectors or elements
summarise_each: to perform an opeartion on all the columns of the dataframe

# Dataframes used

x_test: to read the x dirction test data
y_test: to read the y direction test data
sub_test: to read the subjects test data
x_train: to read the x dirction train data
y_train: to read the y direction train data
sub_train: to read the subjects training data
features: to read the features details
Test_Set: has the complete test data
Train_Set: has the complete train data
Activity_Set: has the complete mean and standard deviation data
Meanstdset: has the data for calculatons involving only mean and standard deviation
average_set: has the complete average dataset of Meanstdset grouped at an activity and subject level
